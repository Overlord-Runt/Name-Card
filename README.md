# Name-Card

Hello!\
This is a name card I made for me to wear at hackathons and events.\
It has 6 leds, 6 Buttons, and a Buzzer, all powered on a CR2032 Cell Battery.

## What This does

This is a nametag that clips onto your shirt with a safety pin.\
It has 5 LEDs that turn on through buttons on the right and a buzzer that turns on through the button on the left.\
The 6th LED is to express my social battery as it depreciates throughout the day.\
All of this runs on a 3V CR2032 cell battery
