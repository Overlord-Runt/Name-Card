# Name-Card

Hello!\
This is a name card I made for me to wear at hackathons and events.\
It has 6 leds, 6 Buttons, and a Vibration Motor, all powered on a CR2032 Cell Battery.

## What This does

This is a nametag that clips onto your shirt with a safety pin.\
It has 5 LEDs that turn on through buttons on the right and a vibration motor that turns on through the button on the left.\
The 6th LED is to express my social battery as it depreciates throughout the day.\
All of this runs on a 3V
CR2032 cell battry
